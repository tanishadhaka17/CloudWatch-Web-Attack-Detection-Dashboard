# CloudWatch Traffic - Web Attack Detection Dashboard

This project analyzes and visualizes web attack traffic logs collected from **AWS CloudWatch** to identify suspicious activity, attacker behavior, and traffic anomalies.  
The dashboard is built using **Power BI** with data preprocessing in **Excel**.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To monitor, detect, and visualize **suspicious web traffic and attack attempts** using AWS CloudWatch logs and create actionable threat-intel dashboards.

---

## 📊 Key Insights & Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Total Events | Total number of traffic logs recorded |
| Unique Attackers | Count of unique attacker IPs |
| Unique Countries | Geographic attack distribution |
| Detection Type | Detected rule/alert type (WAF Rule hits) |
| Protocol Analysis | HTTP/HTTPS traffic breakdown |
| Daily Traffic Trend | Traffic volume timeline |
| Source IP | Identifies top suspicious source IPs |
| Data Transfer | Bytes in/out per request |

---
